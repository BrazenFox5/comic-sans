# comic-sans
Hello stranger.
This is a theme for BetterDiscord designed to give Comic Sans font to discord.


To install, place Font.theme.css to %APPDATA%\betterdiscord\themes > Discord > Settings > Themes > Comic Sans Font v(VERSION) by @Nostalgia#5187 > "Enable Switch" Toggle on.
This is to not be on sale, as it is open sourse. If I find my theme on your site for $$$, I will gladly take it down. If it's free and credits this Github, I'm perfectly fine with it.

If you want to share, this is the link: https://github.com/BrazenFox5/determination-mono - offically made by BrazenFox5.

So if your confused, I named this Determination Mono, because I thought it was handwriting, but actually no, but Comic Sans. I found this out when I changed my Windows font to Comic Sans. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80448295/113499368-609ae280-94ca-11eb-919b-a09f99670d7b.png)


# archive
Hello there! If you are wondering why this repository is being archived, here is why:
1. I have a new respository full with other BetterDiscord items too
2. Because of reason #1, it would be a waste of time, and repositories if there is a limit.

So please, don't think I'm just not active, I am always trying to improve stuff, (like this theme). I am moving to a new repository https://github.com/BrazenFox5/BetterDiscordStuff and for this project, https://github.com/BrazenFox5/BetterDiscordStuff/tree/main/ComicSans, so check there instead.
